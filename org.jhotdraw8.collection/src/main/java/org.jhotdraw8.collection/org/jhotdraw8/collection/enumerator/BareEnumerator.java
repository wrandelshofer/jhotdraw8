/**
 * Bare (minimalistic) interface for enumerating elements of a collection.
 * <p>
 * The protocol for accessing elements via a {@code BareEnumerator} imposes
 * smaller per-element overhead than {@link Iterator}, and avoids the inherent
 * race involved in having separate methods for
 * {@code hasNext()} and {@code next()}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is typically not used, it is more convenient to use
 * the {@link Enumerator} interface instead, which extends from the
 * {@link java.util.Spliterator} interface.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * <pre>{@literal
 * for (BareEnumerator<E> i = ...; i.moveNext(); ) {
 *   var e = i.current();
 *   ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <E> the element type
