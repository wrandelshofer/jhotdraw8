/**
 * A minimalistic read-only interface to a directed graph.
 * <p>
 * A directed graph is a tuple {@code G = (V, A)} where {@code V} is a set of
 * vertices and {@code A} is a set or bag of arrows.
 * <p>
 * This facade supports a data object for each arrow. The type of the arrow data
 * object is provided by the type parameter {@literal <A>}.
 * <p>
 * Users of this interface may define {@literal <A>} as a tuple
 * {@code (v_i, v_j)} but are not required to do so, because this interface
 * provides methods for accessing the next vertex of a given vertex without
 * having to deal with the arrow object.
 *
 * @param <V> the vertex data type
 * @param <A> the arrow data type
