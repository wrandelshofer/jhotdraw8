LICENSE

This code repository predates the concept of Open Source, and predates most
licenses along such lines. As such, the official license truly is:

EULA: The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other words, you cannot
claim the text of the code as your own and resell it. Using the code is
permitted in any program, product, or library, non-commercial or commercial.
Giving credit is not required, though is a nice gesture. The code comes as-is,
and if there are any flaws or problems with any Gems code, nobody involved with
Gems - authors, editors, publishers, or webmasters - are to be held
responsible. Basically, don't be a jerk, and remember that anything free comes
with no guarantee.
